# Favorite Animals List

## This is a Favorite Animals tracker which takes in user input and then logs the favorite animal to the API call and console logs that animal information in the console. You can also delete the animal from the API and generate HTTP status codes. Learn about animals and HTTP codes at the same time through cat memes!

### Some of the most difficult parts were finding an API that allowed you to use POST, PUT, and DELETE. The example APIâ€™s given to us that I looked through only allowed GET requests. So I had to find a completely separate API that allowed me to test all the requests. 

This project uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
